## More static site generators
This workshop contains instructions on how to set up a site with Jekyll. However,
there are _many_ more static site generators to choose from. [Here  you can see an extensive list of static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/).

Static site generators differ in their goals and programming languages they're
written in. For some examples:
 - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) puts a big focus on making blogs work. It's
   written in Ruby.
 - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is designed with flexibility in mind, and is often used
   for e.g. company websites. It's written in Go. [Theme gallery](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
 - [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) makes it very easy to write documentation for
   projects. It's written in Python.
 - [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) is another blog-aware static site gen.
   It's written in Python.
 - [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) is a minimalistic static site gen, once again
   with a focus on blogs. It's written in Rust.

The process to use custom static site generators differs between GitLab and GitHub.

### GitLab
Some examples:
 - [The Math Soc SIG site](https://maasmath.eu/) uses its own custom Zola template.

## HTML, CSS and Javascript
To build your own templates and to give your site a a fully personalized feel, it's
generally necessary to dive into HTML, CSS and Javascript. Here are some helpful
links:

 - W3 schools provide an in depth guide and documentation for
   [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and
   [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
 - [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) is a site full of code snippets of HTML, CSS and
   Javascript. They also provide [a list of most popular snippets in
   2020](https://codepen.io/2020/popular/pens/)

## Extra content
